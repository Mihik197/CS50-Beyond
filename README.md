This repository is my following along [CS50 Beyond 2019](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381Q6R1jRxgXknYO7VuTYPBI), which picks up where CS50 leaves off and explores web development in more depth with HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Python, JavaScript (ES6), and SQL using frameworks like Flask and React

I followed along with the code in the videos, with some modifications as felt necessary, along with an implementation of the projects at the end of each video

The course is very slightly outdated having been filmed in 2019 but most of the content and the concepts taught are still relevant. The instructor is excellent.
